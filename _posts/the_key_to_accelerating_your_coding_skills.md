#快速提升编码技能的关键

###[The Key To Accelerating Your Coding Skills](http://blog.thefirehoseproject.com/posts/learn-to-code-and-be-self-reliant/)

>When you learn to code, there is a moment when everything begins to change. At Firehose, we like to call this the inflection point of coding. After this phase, the way you operate as a developer will be dramatically different. Building up to the inflection point is the process of becoming self-sufficient in programming, to the point where you no longer need any hand-holding. It can be a frustrating experience, but once it’s behind you, it is incredibly empowering.

在学习编程时，你会经过一个特殊时期，之后，一切都变得不一样。
在Firehorse（一个教育机构）内部, 我们倾向于称它为编码能力的转折点。此阶段之后，作为开发者，你的编程体验会截然不同。
而跨越转折点，就是在编程中开始自立，直到不再需要帮助的过程。这个过程可能是令人沮丧的，可一旦跨过去，你将会变得异常强大。

> At Firehose, our goal isn’t just to teach you Ruby, how to build web applications, or how to write tests. Although we do teach these skills and more, our primary goal is to accelerate students past the inflection point so they gain the ability to solve any problem they encounter. We believe that being able to problem solve on your own is an invaluable skill, and this method of teaching will take you much further than simply learning how to build a set of apps.

在Firehose，我们的目标不仅仅是教会你Ruby，教会你构建Web应用，或者怎么去些写测试。
尽管我们确实教授这些，甚至更多，我们的主要目标依然是帮助学生更快地越过这个转折点，让他们具备解决遇到的任何问题的能力。
我们坚信，独立解决问题的能力是一项非常宝贵的技能，而"授人以渔"也会比简单的教人构建一组应用程序的教育方式让你走个更远。

> The Tutorial Phase (3-8 weeks of serious coding)

>  When you start out learning to code, there’s a lot of information that you don’t know yet. This information is called domain-specific knowledge. Examples include: knowing how to write a loop in ruby or how to extract something from a database using Ruby on Rails. Domain-specific knowledge encompasses the protocols unique to a certain programming environment.

> The first step to becoming a self-sufficient developer is learning how to do specific tasks. Once you master certain tasks, the broad strokes of how the pieces fit together will start to become apparent. Over time, you’ll begin to recognize patterns and eventually, the things that initially seemed confusing and foreign will become second nature.
成为独立开发人员的第一步是学习完成特定的任务。一旦你掌握这些特定任务，各个片段的耦合关系也会变得清晰明确。随着不断地练习，你将认识并理解一些固有模式，最终，那些最初看起来令人困惑和陌生的东西就变得习以为常了。

##参考教程阶段（大约3到8周的高强度编程训练）- 手把手的蜜月期

当你开始学习编程后，会碰到很多之前所不知道的东西。
这些信息被称为特定领域知识。比如说，像如何在Ruby中写循环语句，或者怎么用Ruby on Rails（Ruby的框架）从数据库中抽取数据。
这些特定领域知识依赖于特定编码环境中所特有的约定。


>  For students starting out, the most important skill to acquire is attention to detail.

>  Paying close attention to detail is important when going through materials like documentation or tutorials. Even the most minor typos and misspellings will result in error messages or bugs. Seeing error messages is a frustrating experience at first, but it’s a crucial step in the learning process. Dealing with error messages and problems in this phase teaches you one of the most important skills of programming within a safe environment: being detail-oriented.

###对于刚入门的菜鸟来说，关注细节是首先需要掌握的基本功 - 充满迷惑的下滑期
在遵循文档或教程等材料学习时，关注细节很重要。因为，哪怕最微小的拼写错误也会导致报错或引入缺陷（Bug）。尽管一开始的时候，报错信息会让你内心发憷，但根据报错信息排查异常是学习过程中至关重要的一步。
因为，在当前阶段，处理报错或者问题会教会你一项在受控环境中编程最重要的技能：面向细节编程的能力。

> Debugging error messages is incredibly important. The fact of the matter is, error messages are just a part of programming: they are seen by inexperienced and very experienced developers alike. The only difference is, the more experience you have dealing with error messages, the less time you’ll need to spend trying to fix them. Here’s why:

>  Over time, you will learn how to read error messages and extract the relevant details of the problem quickly. The first time you see an error message, it will take you a while to decode what it actually means. But after you’ve seen hundreds of error messages (and you will see hundreds!), you will be able to pinpoint the problem’s location and the relevant details you need in order to fix it.
   You should learn from each error message that you resolve. Don’t just fix the error and be done with it; understand what is wrong with the code you’re fixing. By learning from each of your errors, the next time you make the same mistake, you’ll be able to fix it much faster.
  Initially, you will probably ask for help on each error message you see. Over time, you’ll learn to ask for help less frequently by double-checking your code and conducting smart Google searches.

**调试报错信息非常重要。** 事实上，无论有没有经验的程序员，都能碰到异常，异常是编程的一部分。唯一的区别在于，你经验越多，修复它们所需要的时间越少。究其原因，如下：
* 随着经验的丰富，你会学会**快速阅读报错信息**并提取相关问题的细节。对于遇到的第一条异常，你肯定需要点时间去理解它的实际含义。可当你见过成百上千以后（事实上你可能会遇到更多），你就能够快速定位，并抽取修复问题所需要的重要信息。
* 你应当**从解决的每一个异常中学习。** 别只是简单的修复就了事；要多想想是什么的导致的问题。从异常中学习，会让你在下一次犯同样错的时候，快速解决。
* 起初，对于遇到的每一个异常你都会寻求帮助。随着时间的推移，你就不会再这么干了，你做的更多的是反复检查，或者查询[搜索引擎](http://blog.thefirehoseproject.com/posts/10-minutes-learn-programming/)。

>In the tutorial phase, you will follow instruction. At first, you’ll find it challenging to follow instructions and error messages will happen frequently. Over time, you’ll develop the skill to debug errors and pay better attention to small details, and you’ll be able to make progress much quicker. As you’re wrapping up the tutorial phase, you’ll notice you’re able to write code at a much more rapid pace.

参考教程的时候，你会按部就班，遵照说明一步步的做。即便如此，刚开始的你，依然会觉得完全照搬教程学习也压力山大，结果错误频出。但假以时日，慢慢你就掌握了调试报错的方法，且更加关注细节，并能快速取得进展。
最后，你会发现，完成教程的你已经拥有了不错的代码编写能力。

>At this point, some people feel confident– like they’re ready to ditch the training wheels and start building things without structured guidance– and will happily dive into the deep end. Other students will reach for more tutorials, trying to obtain more domain-specific knowledge in search of a “full understanding.” Unfortunately, tutorials will only take you so far, and true confidence isn’t found in tutorials or guides. True confidence comes from struggling through a problem you have no idea how to solve, and discovering a solution on your own.

完成教程后，有些人会异常自信，不再愿意局限于此--开始不再依赖指导，并尝试自己来做东西了--他们也乐于去挑战一些非常有难度的东西。
而其他同学则希望学习并完成更多的教程，试图掌握更多特定领域(domain-specific)知识，以达到"完全理解"。非常可惜的是，教程只能帮你到这里，从教程或指南中是找不到真正的自信的。
真正的自信来自于你一步步尝试并最终解决那些完全没头绪的问题的过程中。

> The dirty little secret of programming is… You will never know everything you need to know to solve all your problems. Going into the journey, you probably envisioned yourself eventually learning everything you need to learn, and then being squared away. This moment will never happen.

> Programming is a life-long learning experience. Experienced software engineers seek to find solutions to problems they haven’t solved yet because it gives them the opportunity to learn more. If you find yourself waiting for the moment when you finally feel like you know everything there is to know about coding, know this: the day you’re waiting for will never come. And that is a wonderful thing.

***关于编程，一个不太乐观的小秘密是***，你不可能掌握解决问题所需全部知识的。
你可能会设想自己总能在编程生涯的某个时间点上，学完所需的技能，然后就此打住。
然而，这一刻永远不会发生。
编程是一个终生学习的苦旅。
经验丰富的软件工程师会给尚未解决的问题寻找解决方案，因为这给了他们更多的学习机会。
如果你发现自己在等待这么一刻，这一刻你终于能把编程的方方面面都了如指掌，那么请记住：你等待的那一刻永远不会来。学无止境，这是多么美妙的一件事情。
![](http://165.227.208.227/posts/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/learn-to-code-1.jpg)

> You will be ready to jump into the next phase of your journey when:

>  You’ve seen enough error messages that they no longer startle you. Instead, you know how to decipher what they mean and where to look for the problems in your code.

>  You’re a pro at Googling for solutions. When you’re working to add a feature or see a confusing error message, you know what to search for to find the information you need.

>  You’re able to reference code you’ve written in other parts of your application and follow patterns within them, rather than always seeking out step-by-step instructions.

**如果能满足下面的条件，你就可以进入编程的下一个阶段了：**
* 你已经见过足够多的报错信息，它们再也**不会吓倒你。** 相反你已经能理解它们的含义，并知道去哪里查找代码中的问题。
* 你已经**能够熟练运用搜索引擎查找解决方案。** 当你添加新功能或者看到一个令人困惑的报错信息时，你已经知道用什么关键词进行检索可以找到所需要的信息。
* 你会**参考你在其他项目中的代码，并参照其设计模式，** 而不再一步步的遵循手册，依葫芦画瓢。

> The Inflection Point (2-4 weeks with the right mentality)
  The inflection point stage is one of the most frustrating stages of learning to code, but in many ways, it’s the only stage that matters. It’s the point when you phase out of using tutorials and begin solving problems for which no one has lined up a solution for you.

>  At some points, you will feel like you aren’t ready to tackle this phase and like you want to return to building something with an outline of exactly what to do. Don’t fall prey to this mentality. The reason you’ll feel frustrated is:

>  During the inflection phase, you will be coding 10-20 times SLOWER than in the previous phase.
  You may start questioning yourself and wondering if you are actually capable of becoming a programmer. Feelings of insecurity and doubt are common in this stage.

>  Despite the fact that you’ll feel like you’re learning and accomplishing things at a much slower rate, in reality, you are achieving the things that matter the most. While your domain-specific knowledge is screeching to a putter, everything you’re learning will be about procedural knowledge.

>  Procedural knowledge is the ability to teach yourself what you don’t know along the way. When you need to implement a new feature, what type of Google search should you do? At this point in time, you’ll feel like you’re “in the dark” when it comes to many of the things you want to accomplish. Learning how to find the light on your own is critical because you can never know everything there is to know, so you need to be able to teach yourself how to solve the problem at hand.

>  Most people do not realize that in order to learn to code, you need to learn both domain-specific and procedural knowledge.

##转折点(平常心对待，2~4周) - 绝望的迷茫期
从很多方面讲，这个阶段是学习编码的过程中，最令人心灰意冷的时期，也是唯一重要的阶段。这个阶段里，你会逐步的停止参照教程，并尝试去解决别人不曾提前给你答案的问题。
某些情况下，你甚至会觉得自己并未做好准备，想退回到上一个阶段，去构建一些有教程指导的事情。你可千万别掉入这个心理陷阱， 真正令你感到沮丧的原因是：
***在这个迷茫期，你的编码速度比上一个阶段要慢10~20倍***，
你可能会开始质疑自己，怀疑自己是否真正有能力成为一个程序员。这种不安和质疑，在这个阶段其实非常普遍。
尽管你觉得现阶段学习和做事的速度非常慢，但实际上，你所完成的事情意义非凡。
当你的特定领域知识学习的七七八八时，你就需要学习[实践性知识](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%BF%87%E7%A8%8B%E6%80%A7%E7%9F%A5%E8%AF%86)了。

所谓实践性知识是指自我探索未知的能力。比如说，当需要实现一个新特性时，你要如何检索呢？
这个时候如果又有太多要做的事情，你就会倍感压力。独立学习找到出路是至关重要的，谁也不是先知，不到山前不知道哪有路，所以你要能够自我学习以解决手头的问题。

**大多数人都没有意识到，专业知识和实践性知识对于学习编程来说都是不可或缺的。**

> For the rest of your life, go outside your limits every single day
  Some software engineers stay inside their comfort zone once they find their footing. These types of programmers are known as maintenance programmers– not something you should strive to be. Instead, you should strive to go outside your limits every single day. The most common reason programmers quit their jobs is because “it’s not challenging anymore since I’ve solved all the interesting problems.”

>  Rather than trying to pull coding projects into your comfort zone, you should be seeking out problems that are outside your current skill set. This is the only way to build on and expand your skills.

>  In the words of a Firehose student upon passing his inflection point:

>  I still feel like I’m in the deep end! I’m just getting more comfortable knowing that’s where I’ve got to be!

###每天进步一点点
有些程序员习惯一站稳脚跟后就宅在舒适区里。这些人通常被称为维护型程序员，你不应该成为这类人。相反，你应该尝试每天突破一点点。
黑客（程序员中的佼佼者）辞职最普遍的原因是"有趣的问题都已经被他解决了，当前工作不再具有挑战。"

相比于待在舒适区里，力所能及的编写一些项目代码，你应该去尝试解决一些稍稍超出目前能力范围的问题。这是你扩展技能树，拓展能力的唯一途径。

一个已经跨过"转折点"的学生说
>虽然依然觉得困惑，但我越来越清楚的知道，这是必经之路。

> In web development, there are actually two inflection points that will come together.
  The web development inflection point is the point when you become capable of building any database-driven application that you want. This means being able to build a web application with many pages that stores and retrieves information from a simple database. Web developers call this: “mastering CRUD.” At this phase, you should also be able to integrate with any 3rd party library (a ruby gem for example) simply by following the documentation provided on GitHub or a blog post.

>  The algorithm and data structures inflection point is a less superficial inflection point, but it is actually more important. Someone who has conquered this point will have mastered the programming language they’re working in, in addition to mastering the fundamentals of programming and having a depth of knowledge for solving complex coding challenges.

>  People who have conquered the algorithm and data structures inflection point will be able to:

>  Write sorting algorithms
  Implement and reverse linked lists
  Understand and write programs leveraging stacks, queues, and trees
  Write computer programs using recursive or iterative solutions
  In short, once you pass this inflection point, you will have mastered data manipulation and will understand the performance implications of your code decisions. Traditional computer science degrees focus exclusively on getting students past the algorithm and data structures inflection point. Many universities teach this with programming languages that are generally not used in the industry, like Scheme, Racket, or LISP.

>  In most technical interviews, the interviewer will assume you’ve passed the web development inflection point, given that’s easier to do, and focus their questions on evaluating your skill in algorithms and data structures. These questions will generally focus on the topics we mentioned above: sorting algorithms, reversing linked lists, and using stacks, queues, and trees.

##在Web开发中，实际上会有两个转折点
第一个转折点是**Web技能转折点**，指的是你有能力构建各种数据库驱动的网络应用。也就是说能够构建多页面网络应用，并且应用会从数据库里存取简单数据。Web开发者称它为掌握了CRUD（增删改查）。
这个时候，你通常能够根据GitHub上的官方文档或者一篇博客去集成任何第三方库（比如说Ruby的Gem）到自己的项目里来。

第二个是*算法和数据结构转折点*，一个不那么容易但是却更重要的转折点。
跨过了这个转折点的人不仅已经掌握了他们所使用的编程语言，还掌握了编程的基础，而且拥有解决复杂问题的深度知识。

跨过了数据结构与算法转折点的人能够：
* 编写排序算法
* 实现并反序输出链表
* 理解并使用堆栈、队列和树等数据结构编程
* 用递归或迭代编写代码

简而言之，一旦跨过这个转折点，你就具备了操作数据的能力，并能够理解代码实现对于性能的影响。
传统的计算机科学专业格外关注如何帮助学生跨过数据结构和算法的转折点。许多大学使用工业化生产中不怎么使用的的编程语言授课，比如Schema、Racket或者LISP。

大多数技术面试中，面试官会假设你已经通过了Web技能转折点，因为这很容易，并把更多问题集中在评估你对数据结构和算法的掌握情况。
这些问题大多会提及我们上面聊过的东西：排序算法，链表逆序，堆栈和树的使用。

> Once a developer has passed both the web development inflection point and the algorithm and data structures inflection point, they hold the keys to the kingdom.

> These developers will be able to solve challenges that intersect the two: complex algorithms that need to be built in the context of advanced web applications. This is at the heart of what professional web developers do every single day.

##一旦开发者通过了Web技能和数据结构与算法转折点，他们就拿到了成功的金钥匙。
这些开发者能够轻松地在高级Web应用程序中构建起所需的复杂算法。这也是一个专业Web开发者日常工作中的核心。

> Consequences of the Inflection Point
  The biggest consequence of the inflection point will sound a bit counterintuitive when you first hear it. Take a deep breath in:

>  When learning to code, domain-specific knowledge doesn’t matter in the grand scheme of things.
  Yup. I’m not joking– it really doesn’t matter that much at all. Once you pass the inflection point, these concepts will fluidly translate with just a week or two of tutorials, maybe even days!

>  What ultimately really matters is:

>  You have a solid grasp on a web development framework
>  You have a solid grasp on writing algorithmically complex code in any programming language

##转折点的深远影响
说起转折点，其最大的影响，刚听起来会有违直觉，下面请屏住呼吸：
> 学习编码时，特定领域的知识在宏观方案中压根不重要。

是的，我不是在开玩笑，它真的没那么重要。一旦你跨过了转折点，学习这些东西如行云流水，仅仅需要看一到两周的教程，甚至几天时间就足够了。

**真正重要的是：**
* 精通Web开发框架
* 善于运用任一语言编写高算法复杂度的代码

> Hiring managers want developers with solid web development and algorithm skills.
  While I was working at PayPal, my team hired a Senior Rails Developer who had no experience in Rails– he had been coding a lot in Python, LISP, and Perl. Within a couple of days, he was already making a big impact. And within weeks: a huge impact. He quickly rose to become the technical team lead and was one of the best hiring decisions I’ve ever been involved in.

>  Don’t sweat the stack. Many people will say things like, “AngularJS is hot these days,” “JavaScript is on the rise,” or “the latest fad is…” My response to that is: “so?” When you’re learning how to program, your singular goal should be to find the inflection point and annihilate it. Once you do, learning that new, sexy fad won’t be a difficult task at all.

>  Become self-reliant. Having the ability to learn new coding skills without structured guidance means you no longer need to wait for anyone to help you out. This means that for the majority of what you need to learn, you can simply search the internet and read the various material on what you need to know.

>  This doesn't mean you immediately “know” everything, but just that everything is now “figure-out-able,” so in essence, you are unstoppable.

##招聘经理希望应聘者具有稳固的Web研发基础和和良好的算法编写能力

当年我在PayPal上班时，我的团队雇了一个完全没有任何Rails经验的人做高级Rails工程师，他编写过大量的Python，LISP和Perl代码。
结果没用几天，他就已经能独当一面，仅几周时间就晋升为技术团队带头人，决定录用他是我在参与过的招聘中做过的最明智的决定。

*别盲目追逐热点*。很多人都我说过这样的话，"AngularJS现在大火"，"JavaScript正在崛起"，或者"最新的趋势是......"
而我的回答往往很简单，"那又怎样呢？"。当你学习如何编程时，你唯一的目标是找到转折点并跨过去。一旦你这么做了，再去学那些新的，或者酷的东西一点也不难。

*学会自立* 能够在没有教程指导下自学编程，意味着你不需要别人的帮助。
同时，也意味着你可以通过搜索引擎搜索并阅读资料来了解并学习你所需要的知识。
这可不是说你能立马知晓一切，而是说各种东西对你来说都是可以理解并掌握的，所以理论上，你是没有上限的。

> The Skills You Will Develop During the Inflection Point

>  As a software developer, the best reference material is similar code that you have already written. When you fully understand the code you’ve written, you don’t need to commit all the details to memory. This means that the first question you should ask yourself when building a new feature is: “Have I built something similar before?” If the answer is yes, revisit the code and walk through the code line-by-line in your head. Re-explain to yourself what it’s doing and ask yourself, “could I use the same approach now?”

>  Videos suck at explaining domain-specific details because they take so darned long to watch. Say you want to integrate with the Google Maps API. Once you’ve experienced doing so once, it can take less than a minute to open the code up in GitHub, copy the code, and paste it into a new project. Videos, on the other hand, can often take 10-30 minutes to re-watch.

###在转折期你会学到的技能
作为一个软件开发人员，最好的的参考资料是你曾写过的类似的代码。
当你能完全读懂并理解之前写的代码时，你就不需要记住所有细节。这意味着，当你开发一个新功能或特性时，应当首先问自己：之前是否做过类似的东西？
如果是的话，那在脑海中一行行的审视、阅读代码，解释给自己听，并询问这次是否可以重用同样的解决方法。

**看视频学习编程简直弱爆了**，它太花多时间了。
比如说，现在你需要集成谷歌地图接口。如果之前有做过的话，你甚至仅需要不到一分钟的时间去打开GitHub，拷贝粘贴相关代码到新项目中来。而如果看视频可能就需要10~30分钟。

> Strategies for Passing the Inflection Point as Efficiently as Possible

>  Because passing the inflection point is the most important part of learning to code, you should set yourself up to make the process as smooth as possible. This means you should start preparing while you’re in the tutorial phase and maintain the right mindset during this period of time.

>  During the tutorial phase, take breaks from going over structured material and give yourself challenge problems along the way.

>  For every handful of lessons, try to do something that is outside the scope of the tutorial you’re following. If the tutorials you’re going through provide “challenges” or “self-directed” pieces, do all of them. Solving unguided challenges will give you the important experience of doing things without structured guidance.
  Try to use tutorials as little as possible. At Firehose, we often walk students through how to integrate certain gems or do things using the provided documentation. Rather than simply following the instructions explained in tutorials that are geared towards people who are just starting out, many students will follow the documentation and use the tutorials as a back-up. Note that documentation will treat you like a developer who has passed the inflection point. Getting comfortable reading and following documentation on GitHub will give you a leg up when you’re on your own.
  Focus on the essentials and use repetition. Learn how to do common things like spinning-up an application from scratch, pushing a new app to GitHub and Heroku, and building a database migration early on.
  Pushing through the inflection point can be challenging. Here are some pointers to get you through it:

>  Understand that this is a difficult process and go easy on yourself. Also, set realistic expectations. You can’t compare your “superman”-level speed of going through tutorials to your “snail”-speed of learning things on your own. Keep in mind that you’re learning plenty, but at this phase, you’re learning a brand new skill of figuring new things out on your own.
  If you’re struggling with self-confidence, know that what you’re feeling is completely normal. Keep working. If you continue to struggle, try talking to someone who has recently passed the inflection point. They will be able to relate to the position you’re in and will assure you that what you’re experiencing is only temporary. Work consistently, but don’t overwork yourself. At this phase of the game, know that you can only be productive for around 6 hours a day at the most. Working in an exhausted state will only prolong the time you spend building up to the inflection point.
  The best way to gain confidence at this stage is to power through any doubts you have. Your emotions may start to feel like a roller coaster. At times, you’ll feel like you’re on fire, but after 15 hours of struggling on the same problem, it’s very common to feel the polar opposite.

>  It can be frustrating to have no idea if something will take you 5 minutes or 5 hours, but every time you power through and successfully implement a new feature, the rush of confidence will be everything you need. After solving a handful of hard problems without any help, you’ll be addicted to the feeling of building things outside your comfort zone.

##快速跨过转折点的诀窍
跨过转折点是学习编程中最重要的部分，你应该脚踏实地，尽可能的顺利地度过。这需要你即便在参考教程阶段就应当开始好好准备，并在之后保持积极的心态。

###在参考教程阶段，注意节奏并适当挑战自己。

* 对于每一个练手实践的章节，去尝试一些超纲的东西。如果当前教程已经提供了练习题，你一定要都完成。
在没有指导的情况下，尝试解决问题会带给你非同寻常的体验。

* 尽量不去参考教程。在Firehose, 我们经常指导学生集成Gems, 或者根据给定文档做些事情。
简单的遵循教程仅适用于初学者，很多学生会查阅文档，教程仅仅是一个补充。
这里要注意，文档定位给已跨过转折点的开发人员使用的。学会阅读并使用GitHub上的文档会让你在独立工作中获得提升。
* 注重要点，适量重复。学习做一些常见或普通的事情，比如从零开始构建一个应用，然后推送到GitHub或者Heroku，或者尽早准备数据库迁移计划。

**跨过转折点是很有挑战的一件事，这里有一些方法可以帮助你**
* 理解这不是个容易的过程，别操之过急。另外，设立短期可达的小目标。你不能拿看教程的神速跟你自己慢慢学习的龟速相提并论。
心里时刻要牢记，你要啃的东西还有很多，但当前阶段，你是在学习一种全新的、自主解决问题的方法。
* 如果你缺乏自信，那么一定要注意这样的感受相当正常。你只需继续加油。如果你还是很纠结，尝试跟刚刚跨过转折点的人聊一聊。
他们清楚你目前的处境，也会鼓励你，当前的状态只是暂时性的。持续学习，但不要过度。在这个阶段，你每天至多有6个小时的高效学习时间。
透支体力只会让你花更多的时间。

通过消除已有的疑虑是当前阶段获得自信心最好的方式。
一开始，情绪像坐上了过山车，七上八下。某一时刻你还会焦躁不安，毕竟在同一个问题上纠结15个小时，心情来回反复很常见。

尽管有时候花了5分钟甚至5小时依然没有头绪会让人很沮丧，但自信心总会在每一次成功实现新功能点后纷至沓来。

> How to know when you’ve passed the inflection point

>  The final stage of the inflection point process is acceptance. Acceptance that software development is a process of continuous learning. Acceptance that the feeling that you’ve successfully learned everything just means you should start thinking about solving more complicated problems.

>  Have you experienced the inflection point yet? Share this post and start a conversation with your friends– you would be surprised how many people have reached and surpassed this moment.

##怎么知道已经跨过了转折点
跨过转折点的最终表现是和解与接受。接受软件开发是一个持续学习的过程。
接受自己以为学无不能的时候仅仅意味着需要思考解决更复杂的问题。

你跨过转折点了吗？分享这篇文章，跟朋友聊一聊，你会惊讶于多少人已经达到或者跨越了这个阶段。
